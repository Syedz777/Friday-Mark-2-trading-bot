Friday Main Mark 2: The Ultimate MT5 Trading Bot Strategy (SMA, WMA, Stochastic, CCI)

Unlock the next level of automated trading with the Friday Main Mark 2 MT5 bot! This expert advisor (EA) is designed to combine the power of four proven technical indicators—SMA (Simple Moving Average), WMA (Weighted Moving Average), Stochastic Oscillator, and CCI (Commodity Channel Index)—to deliver precision entries and exits in the Forex market.

What Makes Friday Main Mark 2 Unique?

Friday Main Mark 2 stands out by integrating multiple confirmation layers before executing a trade. Rather than relying on a single indicator, it cross-verifies signals from four different sources, reducing false positives and increasing the probability of successful trades.

1. **SMA & WMA Crossover**
The bot tracks a 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) and a 20-period Weighted Moving Average (WMA) on any timeframe or symbol. A key trigger is when these two moving averages cross each other—a classic technique to detect trend reversals or continuations.

2. **Stochastic Oscillator Filter**
The strategy utilizes the Stochastic Oscillator (14,4,4) to measure market momentum. Only when both the main Stochastic and its signal line are moving in the same direction as the crossover does the bot consider a trade, further filtering out weak setups.

3. **CCI Confirmation**
To add an extra layer of confidence, the bot uses the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) with a period of 20. Trades are only taken when the CCI confirms the trend direction—above zero for buys and below zero for sells.

4. **One Trade per Bar**
Risk management is built-in: the bot is programmed to take only one trade per bar, avoiding overtrading and reducing exposure to sudden market whipsaws.

5. **Fully Automated with User Controls**
The EA is fully automated once attached to a chart. Users can customize parameters such as lot size, stop loss, take profit, slippage, and all indicator periods to match their risk appetite and trading style.

How Does It Work?

- When a new bar forms, the EA checks for a crossover between the SMA and WMA.
- It then confirms the trend with the Stochastic Oscillator and CCI.
- If all conditions are met, the EA automatically places a trade, with stop loss and take profit levels set according to user preferences.
- The bot checks for existing positions based on a unique Magic Number, ensuring it doesn’t duplicate trades.
